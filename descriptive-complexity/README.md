why use descriptive complexity?
we can prove that a relation is in AC0 using this theorem:
22. importance of descriptive complexity: (https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/resources/pdf/morioka.pdf)
Theorem 2.1. [BIS90, Imm99] A relation  is in  AC0 iff it is representable by an FO-sentence.



- One application of fixed point suffices to express any query expressible with several alternations of fixed point and negation.

- Descriptive complexity theory:
  * FO + Transitive closure operator = NL, nondeterministic logarithmic space
  * FO + Least fixed point operator = P, polynomial deterministic time
  * Existential SO = NP
    
- GrÃ¤del's theorem: on the class of finite structures with a successor relation, the collection of polynomial-time decidable properties coincides with those expressible in the Horn-fragment of existential second-order logic
