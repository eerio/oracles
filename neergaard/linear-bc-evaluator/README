BC Evaluator
============

This package contains an evaluator for the function algebra BC for
PTIME introduced by Bellantoni and Cook [1].  It furthermore contains
an evaluator running in logspace for the linear fragment BC- of BC as
introduced by Ong and Murawski [2] and the linear fragment BC-_epsilon
as introduced by M�ller Neergaard [4].  The evaluator is described by
M�ller Neergaard and Mairson [3, 4].  It is intended to provide a proof
of concept on top of the proof given in [3,4].

Just run sudo apt instal smlnj, will install newer version than 110.0.7,
but still pretty old (from 2022). But it's probably good enough.
Also, sudo apt install rlwrap and run smlnj as `rlwrap sml` to use arrows

The evaluator is written in SML/NJ (Version 110.0.7) and has been
tested under GNU/Linux.  The interpreter is provided in several source
files and are easiest compiled using the SML/NJ's Compilation Manager:
Start the sml interpreter in the directory of the source files.  Then
issue the command to run the compilation manager:

    CM.make "sources.cm";
    Examples.test_suite CBVEvaluator.eval_bc ;


The evaluator package consists of four evaluators which all adhere to
the signature given in Evaluator-sig.sml.  That means that they
contain the following functions:

   eval_bc : 'a Syntax.AS -> Numbers.int list -> Numbers.int list -> Numbers.int
   eval_bcm : 'a Syntax.AS -> Numbers.int list -> Numbers.int list -> Numbers.int
   eval_bcmeps : 'a Syntax.AS -> Numbers.int list -> Numbers.int list -> Numbers.int

The first is an evaluator for BC [1], the second is an evaluator for
BC- [2], and the third is an evaluator for BC-_epsilon [4].  Some of
the evaluators are unable to evaluate all fragments; if the expression
cannot be evaluated, the exception Types.TypeFailure is raised.

The evaluators are

- LogspaceEvaluator: the logspace evaluator for BC- presented in [3].

- LogspaceEvaluatorFunc: a more functional version for BC- and
  BC-_epsilon as presented in [4].

- LogspaceEvaluatorFunctional: a completely functional evaluator for
  BC- and BC-_epsilon.

- CBVEvaluator: a standard call-by-value evaluator for BC, BC-, and
  BC-_epsilon.  This is intended for reference.

Input to the evaluators are syntax trees of type Syntax.S and lists of
integers with the normal and safe arguments.  Syntax trees are build
using the following functions:

   zero : Syntax.S
   s0 : Syntax.S
   s1 : Syntax.S
   p : Syntax.S
   c : Syntax.S
   proj : int * int * int -> Syntax.S
   scomp : Syntax.S * Syntax.S list * Syntax.S list -> Syntax.S
   srec : Syntax.S * Syntax.S * Syntax.S -> S
   
There are a number of predefined syntax trees available in the
structure Examples.  In particular, applying Examples.test_suite to
one of the evaluator functions tests the evaluator function on all the
input in Examples; it precedes the line with !! if the output deviates
from the expected output.  Note however that due to the differences in
the arguments available to the recursive function some of the examples
will produce the wrong output (e.g., CBVEvaluator.eval_bc on
Examples.minus gives the wrong result because Examples.minus is for
linear recursion).

There are a couple of points to notice about the of the logspace
implementations:

- the definition of BC- in [2] explicitly splits the safe arguments of
  safe composition.  We use the standard syntax for BC and just check
  that the arguments can be split affinely.

- we cheat slightly in the implementation: We evaluate the bits from
  least significant to most significant and stop outputting when we
  reach the first non-existing bit.  This is wrong as it violates
  logspace (the output needs to be reversed) and it might lead to
  vacuous zeroes in front of the first significant digit.  A correct
  implementation would rather evaluate the bits from most significant
  to least significant bit and first output bit after the first 1-bit
  has been encountered.  We have chosen the alternative implementation
  as it does not change the core argument (one bit can be found in
  logspace) and it avoids idling through a number of non-existing
  bits.

- it is instructive to try the logspace-evaluator on the non-linear
  BC-function Examples.cbv_show.  It ends up looping infinitely
  because more than one bit of the recursive call is needed.

Due to the restrictions on SML/NJ int type the evaluator is limited to
16-bit numbers.
