[03/11/22] I have started implemented a srec_k constructor which
  extends BC- such that the recursion scheme maintains a fixed k-bit
  register.  It works in CBV-evaluator, but I have not continued into
  the Logspace-evaluator for lack of appropriate syntax.  It should be
  implementable even there, but it is of no use for a TM simulation
  since we cannot communicate between that and a representation of the
  tape.
