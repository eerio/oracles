# Circuit Value Problem
- For a given single-tape, polynomial-time Turing machine `M` and input `x`, in [@Kozen2006], there is an explicit construction of a boolean circuit over (0, 1, `and`, `or`, `not`) (with fan-in 2 for `and`, `or` and 1 for `not`), with one output node, such that its value is 1 if and only if machine `M` accepts input `x`. The construction is in LOGSPACE. So CVP is P-complete w.r.t. LOGSPACE-reductions.
- This is a good example of a LOGSPACE-reduction, being a good benchmark for the LF programming language and for the circuit description language
- The problem is that we can't generate tests for it; we have no database of Turing machines descriptions
