- Connection between logic, category and type theory:
  * Logic: minimal logic = simply typed lambda calculus (positive, implicational fragment of intuitionistic logic)
  * Category: Cartesian closed categories
  * Type theory: finite products only so curry/uncurry enough,
  because we can construct finite products from binary products?
