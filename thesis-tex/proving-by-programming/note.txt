What does x86 arch spec prove?

very simple properties!
forall x. {rax == x} mov rax, 7 { rax == 7}


C++ compiler:

under reasonable assumptions [1], we can tell something about the behavior of a program.

What can we tell?

Reasonable assumptions:
- hardware is correct (manual proof)
- compiler implementation is correct (manual proof)
- (perhaps) OS is correct

-> then program will behave according to the C standard
