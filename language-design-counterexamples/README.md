- Herbelin paradox:
   +  Herbelin, 2005: unrestricted use of `call/cc` and `throw` in a language with dependent sum types and equality leads to an inconsistent system.
   + In a paper from 2012, Herbelin gives restrictions on types that make dependent types compatible with classical reasoning introduced by call/cc
   + Bowman 2018: Herbelin (2005) shows that unrestricted use of call/cc and throw in a language with Î£ types and equality leads to an inconsistent system.  The inconsistency is caused by type dependency on terms involving control effects.  Herbelin (2012) solves the inconsistency by constraining types to depend only on negative-elimination-free (NEF) terms, which are free of effects. This restriction makes dependent types compatible with classical reasoning enabled by the control operators.

- Complete and Decidable Type Inference for GADTs

ensuring data invariants and program correctness among others.
Unfortunately, they pose a tough problem for type inference: we
lose the principal-type property, which is necessary for modular
type inference.
